We’re looking for a Student Intern to join our Data Science and R&D team

Hybrid role

About Sika

Sika is a specialty chemicals company with a leading position in the development and production of systems and products for waterproofing, bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing, and protecting in the building sector and motor vehicle industry. Sika has subsidiaries in 101 countries around the world and manufactures in over 300 factories. Its more than 27,000 employees generated annual sales of CHF 9.3 billion in 2021.

About The Role.

The role centres around the investigation of cutting-edge data science techniques to drive operational efficiency and sustainability initiatives in the manufacture of cementitious products. As part of the R&D network, you will be instrumental in ensuring Sika's trajectory towards becoming the standout low-emissions, high-efficiency supplier of cement-based systems.

Purpose of the Role

The R&D/Data Science student internship has been running for a number of years and has become a critical component of our operations. Students split their time between leveraging data science techniques in order to improve our understanding of industrial raw materials and streamline our portfolio and processes, and working in the laboratory to test their predictions, improving old products, and even designing new ones.

What’s In it for You?

The Opportunity-

Actively pursue an understanding of data science techniques and how they can be utilised in chemical and industrial processes
Spend time working in a research environment, developing a strong knowledge of how different ingredients affect the properties of final products, and the interplay between them
Ideate with a focus on how we can aid in the solution of complex problems using data science, machine learning or AI
Design testing protocols and scrupulously adhere to them, ensuring that your data collection is consistent and complete
The Rewards-

You will be rewarded with a competitive salary, and a sweep of great benefits. We pride ourselves on our total reward package-

Holiday 25 days rising to 28 days with service, plus bank holidays
Hybrid Working
Core Hours Working between 10.00-16.00
A company pension contribution of up to 10%
Private healthcare for you, with option to add family
Group life cover at 6x your annual salary
Global Income Protection (PHI)
Enhanced maternity and paternity pay
Staff discount platform & Cycle to Work scheme
Dedicated Service Awards for reaching key milestones
Selected discounted Sika products
The Support-

You will join the data science unit of Sika UK, which is nestled inside the greater R&D team. Your primary mentorship and supervisor will come from the members of the Data Science unit, but the R&D team will be constantly present, teaching you laboratory techniques and ensuring the social aspect of your hybrid working experience is not lost. The manager of R&D will be your senior line manager. Sika R&D operates under a no doors policy, meaning we are always available to talk.

The Skills-

Joining the R&D / DS team will give you an insight into the different worlds of industrial research, operational logistics and data science. You will come away with a multitude of new skills, in areas including data manipulation; the fundamentals of machine learning; knowledge of cementitious chemistry; understanding of standards and safe manufacturing processes, not to mention significant experience in laboratory and digital work. Each intern has been a success story, boasting achievements from designing new product lines to finding new raw materials that could revolutionise national industry. A significant commitment to professional and personal development from day one.

The Future-

The possession of deep knowledge in the topics of machine learning and data science is an invaluable skill in today's employment landscape. Moreover, despite their prevalence in logistics and manufacturing, such advanced techniques have yet to see sufficient permeation into industrial R&D, especially in the world of construction materials. The pairing of experience in both of these worlds sets you up excellently for a bright future.

Commitment towards Diversity

We welcome expressions of interest from all eligible applicants. The Construction Industry and the Sika salesforce remain disproportionately under-represented by women and we therefore particularly welcome applications from women interested in a sales career in the building supplies and materials industry. Accordingly, we aim to provide an enabling and inclusive working environment for all. We Need Your Skills

What we need from you?

You must be pursuing an undergraduate degree in a field strongly linked to chemistry or process engineering
A strong willingness to learn about completely new, and perhaps unintuitive subjects
Mathematical fluency - a minimum of A-Level is preferred
Excellence in the presentation of complex topics and data to non-expert audiences
No prior coding skills are required, but they are appreciated
Good knowledge of standard laboratory practices, safety and etiquette

JOB TYPE: Freelance, Contract Position (no agencies/C2C - see notes below)
LOCATION: Remote - United States only (TimeZone: PST/CIST | Partial overlap)
HOURLY RANGE: Our client is looking to pay $110 – $130/hr
ESTIMATED DURATION: 40h/week - Long term


THE OPPORTUNITY

What you’ll be working on

Our client's team is seeking a talented Senior Product Designer with strong UI skills and well versed in design systems!

Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen it before. That's what they're trying to do — Their designers create powerful, impactful experiences that enable users of all kinds at organizations to work effectively with data to orchestrate complex marketing campaigns driven by AI. Sometimes that means cutting through the noise and delivering highly streamlined, simple experiences and sometimes it means designing productivity tools for very technical audiences.

They're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people they reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

What You Will Do

Design solutions to real problems and ship great features in their UI
Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.
Work relentlessly to understand their customers
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering and product to craft thorough experiences that are a joy to use
Work in the best medium for the stage of the product development lifecycle you're in, whether that be documents, mockups, prototypes, or presentations
Orient solutions around clear goals, audiences, timeframes, and realistic technical capabilities while always pushing to deliver the best possible experience
Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with the design/product team and company leadership
Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve their design system intentionally as they scale.


What They’re Looking For

You have well-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 6+ years of working experience designing consumer or business SaaS applications (Enterprise product experience is a plus).
You can create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces. (UI)
You can untangle vague conceptual problems, and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value from the product. (UX)
You love making complex problems feel simple and seeing the larger system connect disparate pieces to visualize the user's journey
You have experience in designing Data systems with complex information hierarchies and representing the output of AI
The design decision you make are data driven
You can do basic coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of the procedure or React-level Javascript.)
You care about the business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
You like to tell stories using both words and visuals and strategize the best way to make your point.
You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your role on projects, and shows examples of functional designs that you have developed from start to finish


Bonus points

You have experience working in the data and AI space
You have notion of motion design
You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. Our client is looking to build a diverse team where their skills and experience can complement each other.
You can polish features in the codebase.** They love to hire designers who can code so there's less communication and hand-off cost with engineers. But this is optional, especially if you are super talented in designing the purest and easiest solution to hard product design problems, and rallying your teammates to execute it.*
You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.


Apply Now!

ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:

Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.

C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we’d welcome your application.

Braintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status.

JOB TYPE: Freelance, Contract Position (no agencies/C2C - see notes below)
LOCATION: Remote - United States only (TimeZone: PST/CIST | Partial overlap)
HOURLY RANGE: Our client is looking to pay $110 – $130/hr
ESTIMATED DURATION: 40h/week - Long term


THE OPPORTUNITY

What you’ll be working on

Our client's team is seeking a talented Senior Product Designer with strong UI skills and well versed in design systems!

Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen it before. That's what they're trying to do — Their designers create powerful, impactful experiences that enable users of all kinds at organizations to work effectively with data to orchestrate complex marketing campaigns driven by AI. Sometimes that means cutting through the noise and delivering highly streamlined, simple experiences and sometimes it means designing productivity tools for very technical audiences.

They're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people they reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

What You Will Do

Design solutions to real problems and ship great features in their UI
Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.
Work relentlessly to understand their customers
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering and product to craft thorough experiences that are a joy to use
Work in the best medium for the stage of the product development lifecycle you're in, whether that be documents, mockups, prototypes, or presentations
Orient solutions around clear goals, audiences, timeframes, and realistic technical capabilities while always pushing to deliver the best possible experience
Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with the design/product team and company leadership
Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve their design system intentionally as they scale.


What They’re Looking For

You have well-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 6+ years of working experience designing consumer or business SaaS applications (Enterprise product experience is a plus).
You can create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces. (UI)
You can untangle vague conceptual problems, and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value from the product. (UX)
You love making complex problems feel simple and seeing the larger system connect disparate pieces to visualize the user's journey
You have experience in designing Data systems with complex information hierarchies and representing the output of AI
The design decision you make are data driven
You can do basic coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of the procedure or React-level Javascript.)
You care about the business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
You like to tell stories using both words and visuals and strategize the best way to make your point.
You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your role on projects, and shows examples of functional designs that you have developed from start to finish


Bonus points

You have experience working in the data and AI space
You have notion of motion design
You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. Our client is looking to build a diverse team where their skills and experience can complement each other.
You can polish features in the codebase.** They love to hire designers who can code so there's less communication and hand-off cost with engineers. But this is optional, especially if you are super talented in designing the purest and easiest solution to hard product design problems, and rallying your teammates to execute it.*
You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.


Apply Now!

ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:

Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.

C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we’d welcome your application.

Braintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status.

HOURLY RANGE: Our client is looking to pay $110 – $130/hr
ESTIMATED DURATION: 40h/week - Long term


THE OPPORTUNITY

What you’ll be working on

Our client's team is seeking a talented Senior Product Designer with strong UI skills and well versed in design systems!

Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen it before. That's what they're trying to do — Their designers create powerful, impactful experiences that enable users of all kinds at organizations to work effectively with data to orchestrate complex marketing campaigns driven by AI. Sometimes that means cutting through the noise and delivering highly streamlined, simple experiences and sometimes it means designing productivity tools for very technical audiences.

They're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people they reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

What You Will Do

Design solutions to real problems and ship great features in their UI
Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.
Work relentlessly to understand their customers
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering and product to craft thorough experiences that are a joy to use
Work in the best medium for the stage of the product development lifecycle you're in, whether that be documents, mockups, prototypes, or presentations
Orient solutions around clear goals, audiences, timeframes, and realistic technical capabilities while always pushing to deliver the best possible experience
Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with the design/product team and company leadership
Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve their design system intentionally as they scale.


What They’re Looking For

You have well-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 6+ years of working experience designing consumer or business SaaS applications (Enterprise product experience is a plus).
You can create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces. (UI)
You can untangle vague conceptual problems, and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value from the product. (UX)
You love making complex problems feel simple and seeing the larger system connect disparate pieces to visualize the user's journey
You have experience in designing Data systems with complex information hierarchies and representing the output of AI
The design decision you make are data driven
You can do basic coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of the procedure or React-level Javascript.)
You care about the business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
You like to tell stories using both words and visuals and strategize the best way to make your point.
You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your role on projects, and shows examples of functional designs that you have developed from start to finish


Bonus points

You have experience working in the data and AI space
You have notion of motion design
You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. Our client is looking to build a diverse team where their skills and experience can complement each other.
You can polish features in the codebase.** They love to hire designers who can code so there's less communication and hand-off cost with engineers. But this is optional, especially if you are super talented in designing the purest and easiest solution to hard product design problems, and rallying your teammates to execute it.*
You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.


Apply Now!

ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:

Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.

C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we’d welcome your application.

Braintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings.

Job Description

Heed the call of the never-ending hordes of the undead! Channel your passion to create the next Call of Duty Zombies experiences. As a Treyarch Senior Game Designer working on our Zombies mode, together we will turn nightmarish, adrenaline-fueled dreams into reality!

What You’ll Do…

Act as a Point Designer, the Game Design point of contact who represents your small team of Game Designers for your assigned map and who provides oversight to the team itself.
Work with Design Leadership to create designs and bring them to fruition using scripting and our level editor.
Participate in regular playtests, give feedback and provide recommendations for next iterative direction.
Work with production and leadership to reach product goals.
Learn and grow by collaborating with industry veterans across a wide spectrum of professions.
Mentor other designers as opportunities arise.
Contribute to the success of the team by sharing your unique knowledge and experiences with others, look for opportunities to improve our processes and practices and be an example of treating people with respect.

To succeed you should have…

The ability to contribute directly to the game while also providing oversight on content and team members.
Proficiency with one or more scripting or programming languages (C-like languages a plus).
The ability to clearly articulate and communicate design ideas using any text and visuals to a diverse audience ranging from the visually inclined to the technically minded.
The ability to weigh pluses and minuses to design choices to find the one that best fits the situation, even if that means finding a new solution that no one has thought of.

We’d love it if you also have…

Experience working in a position with Job Responsibilities similar to the above listing with a team of at least 3 game designers in a professional setting.
Proficiency with debugging and problem solving.
Experience with first or third person shooter game design.

Experience with Live Support (patching a live product).

We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all qualifications? Let us decide! Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! At Activision Blizzard, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply.

Covid-19 Hiring Update: We’ve transitioned to a work-from-home model and we’re continuing to interview and hire during this time. This role is expected to begin as a remote position. We understand each person’s circumstances may be unique and will work with you to explore possible interim options.

THE OPPORTUNITY

What you’ll be working on

Our client's team is seeking a talented Senior Product Designer with strong UI skills and well versed in design systems!

Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen it before. That's what they're trying to do — Their designers create powerful, impactful experiences that enable users of all kinds at organizations to work effectively with data to orchestrate complex marketing campaigns driven by AI. Sometimes that means cutting through the noise and delivering highly streamlined, simple experiences and sometimes it means designing productivity tools for very technical audiences.

They're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people they reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

What You Will Do

Design solutions to real problems and ship great features in their UI
Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.
Work relentlessly to understand their customers
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering and product to craft thorough experiences that are a joy to use
Work in the best medium for the stage of the product development lifecycle you're in, whether that be documents, mockups, prototypes, or presentations
Orient solutions around clear goals, audiences, timeframes, and realistic technical capabilities while always pushing to deliver the best possible experience
Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with the design/product team and company leadership
Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve their design system intentionally as they scale.


What They’re Looking For

You have well-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 6+ years of working experience designing consumer or business SaaS applications (Enterprise product experience is a plus).
You can create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces. (UI)
You can untangle vague conceptual problems, and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value from the product. (UX)
You love making complex problems feel simple and seeing the larger system connect disparate pieces to visualize the user's journey
You have experience in designing Data systems with complex information hierarchies and representing the output of AI
The design decision you make are data driven
You can do basic coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of the procedure or React-level Javascript.)
You care about the business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
You like to tell stories using both words and visuals and strategize the best way to make your point.
You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your role on projects, and shows examples of functional designs that you have developed from start to finish


Bonus points

You have experience working in the data and AI space
You have notion of motion design
You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. Our client is looking to build a diverse team where their skills and experience can complement each other.
You can polish features in the codebase.** They love to hire designers who can code so there's less communication and hand-off cost with engineers. But this is optional, especially if you are super talented in designing the purest and easiest solution to hard product design problems, and rallying your teammates to execute it.*
You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.

JOB TYPE: Freelance, Contract Position (no agencies/C2C - see notes below)
LOCATION: Remote - United States only (TimeZone: PST/CIST | Partial overlap)
HOURLY RANGE: Our client is looking to pay $110 – $130/hr
ESTIMATED DURATION: 40h/week - Long term


THE OPPORTUNITY

What you’ll be working on

Our client's team is seeking a talented Senior Product Designer with strong UI skills and well versed in design systems!

Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen it before. That's what they're trying to do — Their designers create powerful, impactful experiences that enable users of all kinds at organizations to work effectively with data to orchestrate complex marketing campaigns driven by AI. Sometimes that means cutting through the noise and delivering highly streamlined, simple experiences and sometimes it means designing productivity tools for very technical audiences.

They're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people they reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

What You Will Do

Design solutions to real problems and ship great features in their UI
Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution.
Work relentlessly to understand their customers
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering and product to craft thorough experiences that are a joy to use
Work in the best medium for the stage of the product development lifecycle you're in, whether that be documents, mockups, prototypes, or presentations
Orient solutions around clear goals, audiences, timeframes, and realistic technical capabilities while always pushing to deliver the best possible experience
Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with the design/product team and company leadership
Create new patterns that are intuitive, practical, and convergent. Evolve their design system intentionally as they scale.


What They’re Looking For

You have well-rounded skills and experience to run projects independently end to end. 6+ years of working experience designing consumer or business SaaS applications (Enterprise product experience is a plus).
You can create clear, intuitive, and visually appealing human interfaces. (UI)
You can untangle vague conceptual problems, and have a sharp intuition for the most accessible mental models and flows, so users can immediately start gaining value from the product. (UX)
You love making complex problems feel simple and seeing the larger system connect disparate pieces to visualize the user's journey
You have experience in designing Data systems with complex information hierarchies and representing the output of AI
The design decision you make are data driven
You can do basic coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of the procedure or React-level Javascript.)
You care about the business needs, implications, and practicality of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI or deep abstractions and can balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who collaborates well with different stakeholders. You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision.
You like to tell stories using both words and visuals and strategize the best way to make your point.
You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your role on projects, and shows examples of functional designs that you have developed from start to finish


Bonus points

You have experience working in the data and AI space
You have notion of motion design
You've designed and built great tools with small teams in the past.
You bring unique strengths and perspectives to the team. Our client is looking to build a diverse team where their skills and experience can complement each other.
You can polish features in the codebase.** They love to hire designers who can code so there's less communication and hand-off cost with engineers. But this is optional, especially if you are super talented in designing the purest and easiest solution to hard product design problems, and rallying your teammates to execute it.*
You've experienced the pain of fragmented tools and information silos created by them, and have a strong urge to fix it.


Apply Now!

ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:

Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform.

Canon Professional Printing (CPP), formerly Océ, is a leading multinational manufacturer ofhigh-end digital inkjet printing hardware and software for professional printing markets. CPP solutions are used by variety of customers in different markets, having different business models.




In addition to supporting diverse businesses, CPP printing solutions are also used in varied ways and workflows, at different scales and process integrations. Even between two similar types of customers there might be considerable differences in how they organize their work, both at company and at operator level.




To address this diversity, CPP is developing the Pigment Design System as one design system across the whole hardware and software portfolio. Pigment Design System is the basis for all UIs, making them highly flexible and customizable for an optimal and personalized experience. How users configure and interact with these UIs gives CPP an understanding about customer workflows and how CPP products are used in these workflows.




Through this research done by means of Pigment Design System, CPP aims to better understand customers and customer roles through collecting and analysing interaction flows and contextual data, and
to help customers get more value from the CPP solutions by means of better workflow integration, AI-supported personalization and advanced analytics.




This project offers two 4-year design-research PhD positions. To address the goal of Canon Professional Printing, we will, together with the CPP design and R&D teams, focus on two clusters of research questions around UI/UX and functionality/service:




How can data and AI techniques help in getting more insight in how users compose their UI ecosystem based on the applications provided within the Pigment Design System. More specifically, we want to address the following questions:
Which Pigment functionalities are used by which roles?
How much are the applications active and used per role?
What are the primary and secondary applications?
What UI optimizations per specific environment are recommended to boost productivity and improve accessibility of service offerings?
How can data and AI techniques help in getting more insight in how different users utilize printers and software in their workflows. More specifically, we want to address the following questions:
Which products and (functionalities within the products) are prominently used or entirely absent in each environment?
Which functionalities are used in combination?
What bottlenecks can be found in customer workflows?
Which optimized workflows for each environment are recommended to prevent redundancies and discover missing solution opportunities?




This project aims to generate new knowledge and actionable methodological advances regarding workflow design for smart operator support, workflow-oriented and servitized predictive maintenance, and finally the use of digital twins in the user interface design of high-tech systems. The project will be part of the EAISI program and therefore share, learn, and disseminate within the EAISI community and through the TU/e master programs Data Science and AI, AI in Engineering Systems. The project aims for open-access publishing of widely applicable methods and is organized to enable close collaboration and colocation of researchers from the project partners. The project leverages ongoing methodological developments in the Industrial Design department with other regional industries (for example, e/MTIC MEDICAID project), and will use and contribute to the ‘Data-AI in Design’ efforts at TU/e and beyond.




You will be part of an innovative multi-disciplinary team




The two PhD positions will be embedded in a multidisciplinary academic and industrial supervision team to tackle the challenges in a timely and effective way. The research will be carried out in three phases: contextual research, data-supported design, and evaluation and iteration.




Design Research PhD position 1: understanding customers and customer roles




In this design research position, the PhD student will explore how to use data-enabled design methods to understand and evaluate the context, the roles, and the workflows of CPP customers. During the first phase he/she will be carrying out contextual research by means of in-depth functional data collection and qualitative methods. In the second phase he/she establishes data-supported design. In the third phase he/she will be leading the evaluation.




Design Research PhD position 2: designing new workflow integrations with AI-supported personalization




In this design research position, the PhD student will explore how to design for and evaluate workflow integrations and work with advanced analytics to develop AI-supported personalization tools. During the first phase, he/she will be generating propositions based on the insights in the design of adaptive, personalized user interfaces in the Pigment design system. In the second phase, he/she will design and implement new UIs and workflow support. In the third phase, he/she will follow the evaluation and iterate accordingly.




Methodologically, we will rely on data-supported ethnography, data-enabled design, and research-through-design, and leverage CPP’s data platform and analytics expertise. Throughout the project, we see opportunities to work with advanced artificial intelligence to steer real-time data collection, product and UI adaptation and the modelling of workflows. Given the multi-disciplinarity of EAISI researchers and partners, we will be able to rely on experts in data mining, process mining, federated learning, and hybrid machine-learning approaches to further refine analysis and design propositions. The two PhD candidates will closely collaborate and share design research methods, data, AI models, and technological platforms as complementary focus points of each PhD position.




The PhD students will explore the questions by applying the research through design methodology with hands-on designing and prototyping in close contact with the CPP R&D teams, users, and stakeholders of the Pigment Design System such as UX architects, UX designers, Visual UX Designers, Quality Leads and Workflow Architects. These will be closely involved in the co-creation process.

About Us:

Meta Materials Inc. “META®” (NASDAQ: MMAT) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and intelligent surfaces that are scalable, sustainable, and efficient. Through applied physics and advanced design, we are pioneering a new class of multi-functional materials — called metamaterials — which have engineered properties that Go Beyond what is found in nature. Our extensive technology platform encompasses three core capabilities, holography, lithography, and wireless sensing, and is software and AI-design driven. This allows us to develop a library of solutions and functional prototypes much faster and at lower cost than traditional chemical synthesis.

Our technology platform enables leading global brands to deliver breakthrough products to their customers in consumer electronics, 5G communications, health and wellness, aerospace, automotive, and clean energy. Our nano-optic technology provides anti-counterfeiting security features for government documents and currencies and authentication for brands.

META has worked with some of the world’s leading companies including Airbus, Satair, Lockheed Martin, and Sekisui. META’s Nanotech business recently renewed a frame agreement with a top-ten central bank to develop a new security feature, and has delivered its LumaChrome™ security feature for more than 30 banknote denominations.

At META we make surfaces smarter, more sustainable, and we do more with less. Together with our partners, we go beyond what’s possible today by creating intelligent surfaces that protect, detect and connect.

Our achievements have been widely recognized, including being named a Lux Research Innovator of the Year in 2021. Learn more at www.metamaterial.com","

Job Description

The use of robotics in the construction industry is an evolving field. Robotics can provide solutions for current challenges in the construction industry such as the increasing construction demand, the shortage of staff, health and safety issues, and the quest for a more sustainable and efficient use of materials and (energy) resources. For instance, robotics can i) support human construction activities, thereby providing enhanced labour productivity; ii) prevent heavy lifting and manoeuvring by humans, thereby providing ease of construction and avoiding health and safety issues; and iii) use materials and resources in an optimized and precise manner, thereby preventing loss and wastage. Overall, this can lead to reduced construction costs and more efficient and sustainable structures.

Efficient deployment of robotics in construction can be further leveraged by the use of associated digital technologies such as, Building Information Modelling (BIM); digital twinning; sensing technologies; artificial intelligence (AI); design optimization; block chain technology; additive manufacturing (AM) and digital reality techniques (i.e. virtual, augmented, mixed or extended reality (VR/AR/MR/XR)). Further integration of these technologies within robotics in construction is therefore of great interest.

The Scientific Challenges Include, But Are Not Necessarily Limited To, The Following Aspects

As assistant professor you will further advance the field of robotics in construction and develop digital technologies that enable the robotic construction of safe, smart and sustainable structures (e.g. for buildings, facades, bridges, etc.).

The development of novel robotics-oriented digital design & engineering tools, that enable optimized structures;
The development of robotic repair, remanufacturing, de- and re-construction technologies, that enable circular structures;
The integration of robotics-related digital technologies (e.g. AI, AM, BIM, VR/AR, etc.) to inform the digital design & engineering process, to derive accurate digital models and to enhance the robotic construction processes;
The experimental and numerical investigation of robotically fabricated components and structures, to determine their mechanical performance and to develop accurate numerical prediction models.

The position is located within the department Mechanics, Management & Design (3MD). 3MD focuses on the design, mechanics, materials and management of civil infrastructures and buildings. A multi-scale research approach is followed, starting at micro-scale (materials), to meso-scale (structures) and to macro-scale (infrastructures/systems). The department governs the entire life cycle from develop, design, build, maintain, operate to demolish or reuse. The department has strong competences in modelling and design for both civil infrastructures as well as buildings.

The position is embedded in the section Applied Mechanics, being part of the Department Materials, Mechanics, Management and Design (3MD). Within Applied Mechanics the group Structural Design & Building Engineering focusses on realizing safe, smart and sustainable structures and infrastructures. This field is deeply influenced by a demand to reduce impact of structures and infrastructures on society. Societal challenges are climate change, risk aversity in society, increasing pressure on use of space and new design techniques. New developments in structural design (e.g. parametric design, virtual/augmented reality, digitisation of the design and construction chain) together with further developments in existing technologies (BIM, FEM, digital prototyping) are expected to have major impact. The group is deeply involved in education, providing four courses in the BSc Civil Engineering and eight courses in the MSc Civil Engineering.
