We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As a Machine Learning Intern, you will:

Design, train and improve upon cutting-edge models
Train extremely large scale models on massive datasets
Explore continual and active learning strategies for streaming data
Publish your work in top-tier conferences and journals
Learn from experienced senior machine learning technical staff
Work closely with product teams to develop solutions
Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build and wear multiple hats!


You may be a good fit if you have:

Proficiency in Python and related ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR
Experience using large-scale distributed training strategies
Familiarity with autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformers
Strong communication and problem-solving skills
A demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products
Bonus: experience writing kernels for GPUs using CUDA
Bonus: experience training on TPUs


If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks:

🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment

🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research

🍽 Free daily lunch

      ",2023-01-05,"Who We Are:

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.  




That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis. 




Who You Are:

You love to solve challenging problems and believe there is no problem too large to tackle. You are an innovator passionate about building products from the ground up, and you don't mind getting your hands dirty. Building a startup is a marathon, not a sprint, and you should be willing to be resilient amidst the challenges that arise with building a new company. You deeply desire to create a company that will significantly impact the world. You are passionate about social initiatives, diversity and inclusion. You are an excellent technologist with good experience.




Qualifications:

A knack for learning and creating.
A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
Good English language as it is the language of the startup.




Key Responsibilities:

Design and develop natural language processing systems
Define appropriate datasets for language learning
Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
Develop NLP systems according to requirements
Train the developed model and run evaluation experiments
Find and implement the right algorithms and tools for NLP tasks
Perform statistical analysis of results and refine models
Constantly keep up to date within the field of machine learning
Maintain NLP libraries and frameworks
Implement changes as needed and analyze bugs




Compensation:

All compensation will come as equity geared towards the long-term upside. We are currently pre-revenue. This will be an evolving discussion as we build our paying active user base.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).


Our Team

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.

Our leadership inspires. Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).


Our Team

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries.

Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

Through our expertise, mindset, culture and most importantly with your help we are turning the AI landscape upside down. Are you up for the challenge?

Our proposition to you

We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.
Transparent salary and career planning from day one.
A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.
Flexible, family-friendly work environment - we have parents in the team and support them.


Success in the role means that you will have

After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.
After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.
After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.


Your Character Traits

Strong inner drive to get things done: you’re not waiting for others to manage or tell you what to do. You are self-driven and you like to work autonomously.
You hate boxes: You don’t stop when your thing is done, and you don’t point to the other side. Instead, you are eager to learn and support in areas that may not be your core expertise.
Quality ambassador: you combine an obsession with quality with a highly pragmatic prioritisation of tasks to maximize your project throughput.
Exceptional communicator: you have excellent communication, presentation and interpersonal skills that enable you to quickly establish an emotional bond.


You fit in with our team culture if you

Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players, not data ninjas.
Have a highly ambitious, curious and driven mindset while being able to convey humility and respect for different opinions.
Feel like a global citizen with a strong passion for openness and diversity.
See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


Tasks

You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.


Requirements

An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.
Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.
Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.
Excellent written and verbal communication, with the ability to work cross-functionally with non-scientific experts.


Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

The VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research is part of the VIB Life Sciences Institute and is embedded within the University of Leuven, which ranks among the world’s top 50 universities. At our Center, more than 300 researchers study the basic mechanisms of the central nervous system and related diseases.




The Laboratory of Computational Biology (www.aertslab.org) is looking for an expert in artificial intelligence. Our team works on deep learning applications for genomics and single-cell genomics, the integration of large datasets, and the interpretation of genomic variation in health and disease. Examples of recent deep learning models developed in the lab include DeepMEL and DeepMEL2, models trained on genomic regulatory sequences involved in melanoma skin cancer (Minnoye & Taskiran, Genome Research 2020; Kalender Atak & Taskiran, Genome Research 2021) and DeepFlyBrain, a deep learning model for gene regulation in the fruit fly brain (Janssens, Aibar & Taskiran, Nature 2022).




The candidate will develop new deep learning solutions, including convolutional neural networks, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, to build predictive models, particularly focused on cell type diversity in the brain and in cancer. These models will be used to gain mechanistic insight into normal and disease-related biological processes, hence the explainability of these models (XAI) is crucial. Depending on the interest, the candidate can be involved in projects related to evolution, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy. Finally, the position will allow exploring future interactions between neuroscience research and research in artificial neural networks.




Profile




You obtained a Master's or Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, Bioinformatics, or equivalent.
Proficient in Python programming
Experience with machine learning (e.g., Tensorflow/Keras/PyTorch)
Experience with explainable AI (e.g., SHAP) is a plus
Experience with high-performance computing, software containers
Experience with genomics is a plus, but not absolutely essential
Ability to work independently and in a team.




We offer




Access to state-of-the-art compute & GPU infrastructure
A stimulating international research environment
Competitive salary and benefits
3-year funding available
Starting date: as soon as possible

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

Our Values

Our mission drives us forward. Our values guide us along the way. In order to meet our goals, we require passion from everyone on the team that is driven by our purpose. We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

Description

Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding.

Life at Builder.ai

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWillYouBuild

About The Role

We are looking for a whipsmart Senior Analyst who can research into a wide array of topics, build models/spreadsheets (google sheets) and narrate back a presentation of their findings. This person needs to be both data first and yet have the power of story telling.

This is an exciting opportunity to work in a fast growing scale-up and yet always be on your toes. The role will have you work on multi-dimensional projects that will test your research chops but also require you to analyse internal and external datasets to help understand both macro and micro trends, within and outside the business. You will work with our Chief Wizard directly and have a front seat view of the business scaling.

Requirements

First Principles thinking
Experience creating models
Excellent presentation & story telling skills
Highly analytical thinking approach
Must be competent in, Google Sheets, SQL, Qlik - (or another similar system)
Strong research techniques
Experience in a similar position would be highly desirable

Benefits

Performance-based bonuses and stock options
24 days of paid annual leave + bank holidays + 2 family days off & time off between Christmas and New Year
Generally flexible working hours
A collaborative culture where unconventional thinkers come together to solve interesting problems and have fun while doing it
Mission-driven company that is making the world a better place

Some of our benefits…..

Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

Ship state of the art models to production.

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.

As a Machine Learning Intern, you will:

Design, train and improve upon cutting-edge models
Train extremely large scale models on massive datasets
Explore continual and active learning strategies for streaming data
Publish your work in top-tier conferences and journals
Learn from experienced senior machine learning technical staff
Work closely with product teams to develop solutions
Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build and wear multiple hats!


You may be a good fit if you have:

Proficiency in Python and related ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR
Experience using large-scale distributed training strategies
Familiarity with autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformers
Strong communication and problem-solving skills
A demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products
Bonus: experience writing kernels for GPUs using CUDA
Bonus: experience training on TPUs


If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

      ",2023-01-05,"Who We Are:

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.  




That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis. 




Who You Are:

You love to solve challenging problems and believe there is no problem too large to tackle. You are an innovator passionate about building products from the ground up, and you don't mind getting your hands dirty. Building a startup is a marathon, not a sprint, and you should be willing to be resilient amidst the challenges that arise with building a new company. You deeply desire to create a company that will significantly impact the world. You are passionate about social initiatives, diversity and inclusion. You are an excellent technologist with good experience.




Qualifications:

A knack for learning and creating.
A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
Good English language as it is the language of the startup.




Key Responsibilities:

Design and develop natural language processing systems
Define appropriate datasets for language learning
Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
Develop NLP systems according to requirements
Train the developed model and run evaluation experiments
Find and implement the right algorithms and tools for NLP tasks
Perform statistical analysis of results and refine models
Constantly keep up to date within the field of machine learning
Maintain NLP libraries and frameworks
Implement changes as needed and analyze bugs




Compensation:

All compensation will come as equity geared towards the long-term upside. We are currently pre-revenue. This will be an evolving discussion as we build our paying active user base.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.

Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools.

Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

Our proposition to you

We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.

Your Character Traits

Strong inner drive to get things done: you’re not waiting for others to manage or tell you what to do. You are self-driven and you like to work autonomously.
You hate boxes: You don’t stop when your thing is done, and you don’t point to the other side. Instead, you are eager to learn and support in areas that may not be your core expertise.
Quality ambassador: you combine an obsession with quality with a highly pragmatic prioritisation of tasks to maximize your project throughput.
Exceptional communicator: you have excellent communication, presentation and interpersonal skills that enable you to quickly establish an emotional bond.


You fit in with our team culture if you

See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


Tasks

You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.


Requirements

An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.

We believe that AI is a net positive force in the world. Our vision and mission are to help rebuild AI infrastructure to advance humanity and our environment. We will do whatever it takes to empower our customers, team, and company to benefit from that pursuit. You can read about our culture and careers here to understand how we work and what we value.

We are owners and advocates for the underlying technologies, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure. These essential building blocks form the high-quality and coherent experiences our users expect. We aim to drive the pace of innovation for every AI/ML developer.

About the role:

ML developers today face significant friction in taking trained models into deployment. They work in a highly fragmented space, with incomplete and patchwork solutions that require significant tuning and non-generalizable/model-specific enhancements. When problems arise with a given model, the tools at their disposal are largely framework-specific, rather than providing a holistic view of both the model and the execution environment. At Modular, we are building the next generation AI platform that will radically improve the way developers build and deploy AI models.

As an AI Tools Engineer you will build and own tools that will be developed with AI workloads and their unique requirements as the focus. This will include performance and accuracy tracking and debugging tools, as well as tooling to provide greater insight into both AI model and compiler decision making. Your work will directly contribute to developing a next-generation AI developer platform and will be on a critical path for customers.

LOCATION: This role is based out of North America. You can work out of one of our offices in Palo Alto, CA or Seattle, WA, or remotely from home.

What you will do:

Implement developer tools that provide a significantly enhanced experience to AI developers.
Engage with users to understand pain points and critical user journeys.
Design and implement methods to gather useful metrics from the SW stack.
Show users how to use Modular's tools to analyze, debug, and improve latency and accuracy through notebooks, documentation, and tutorials.
Emphasize providing an intuitive and consistent experience across local and cloud environments.
Interface with users to design, build, and maintain tools.


What you bring to the table:

2+ years of experience with software development in C++ and Python with data structures/algorithms.
2+ years of experience testing, maintaining, or launching software products.
Prior experience with developing developer tools and methodologies.
Meticulous in work, analytical in thought and tenacious in attitude.
Team player and problem solver, with an ability to explain complex technical issues with clarity and conciseness.


Helpful experience (Optional):

Experience with developer tooling concepts such as profiling, instrumentation, API tracing, hardware tracing, debugging.
Experience with web frameworks and cloud deployment pipelines.


What Modular brings to the table:

Amazing Team. We are a progressive and agile team with some of the industry's best engineering and product leaders.
Flexible Location. We want you to work where you are most productive and we are a remote-first company. We have offices in Palo Alto, CA and Seattle, WA for collaboration, and will open more next year.
World-class Benefits. In order to attract the best, we need to offer the best. Premier insurance plans, up to 5% 401k matching, very generous WFH setup stipends, flexible paid time off, and more are available to you! Please note that specific benefit packages may vary based on your location.
Competitive Compensation. We offer very strong compensation packages, including stock options. We want people to be focused on their best work and believe in tailoring compensation plans to meet the needs of our workforce.
Team Building Events. We organize regular team onsites and local meetups in different cities.


Working at Modular will enable you to grow quickly as you work alongside incredibly motivated and talented people who have high standards, possess a growth mindset, and a purpose to truly change the world.

Modular is proud to emphasize an equal opportunity, safe environment for people to do their best work. Modular is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements.

This employer participates in E-Verify and will provide the federal government with your Form I-9 information to confirm that you are authorized to work in the U.S. If E-Verify cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is required to give you written instructions and an opportunity to contact Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Social Security Administration (SSA) so you can begin to resolve the issue before the employer can take any action against you, including terminating your employment. Employers can only use E-Verify once you have accepted a job offer and completed the Form I-9.","

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).




Our Team

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.




Our leadership inspires. Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.




We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We currently offer equity packages and other benefits on top of cash compensation. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

Description

Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding.

Life at Builder.ai

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWillYouBuild

About The Role

We are looking for a whipsmart Senior Analyst who can research into a wide array of topics, build models/spreadsheets (google sheets) and narrate back a presentation of their findings. This person needs to be both data first and yet have the power of story telling.

This is an exciting opportunity to work in a fast growing scale-up and yet always be on your toes. The role will have you work on multi-dimensional projects that will test your research chops but also require you to analyse internal and external datasets to help understand both macro and micro trends, within and outside the business. You will work with our Chief Wizard directly and have a front seat view of the business scaling.

Requirements

First Principles thinking
Experience creating models
Excellent presentation & story telling skills
Highly analytical thinking approach
Must be competent in, Google Sheets, SQL, Qlik - (or another similar system)
Strong research techniques
Experience in a similar position would be highly desirable

Benefits

Performance-based bonuses and stock options
24 days of paid annual leave + bank holidays + 2 family days off & time off between Christmas and New Year
Generally flexible working hours
A collaborative culture where unconventional thinkers come together to solve interesting problems and have fun while doing it
Mission-driven company that is making the world a better place

      ",2022-12-11,"Faculty is one of Europe’s leading applied artificial intelligence companies. We build, deploy and operate AI solutions to increase our customers’ performance and help them realise their full potential. We believe that AI should be trustworthy, impactful and beneficial across society. Those principles have shaped our work with more than 230 organisations across the public and private sectors as we help them use AI to understand more deeply, make better decisions and act faster.

To give an example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we built the COVID-19 Early Warning System to forecast hospital admissions and life-saving equipment up to three weeks in advance. The ground-breaking tool helped frontline workers at the NHS save lives. We also work with the Home Office on Counter-Terrorism initiatives - Faculty built an AI model that automatically detects both new and existing propaganda videos and stops them from being uploaded.

Please note that due to the nature of our current project requirements, applicants must either hold valid existing security clearance, or be eligible for UK security clearance (5 years continuous UK address history, no criminal convictions). Faculty will cover in full any costs associated.

What you'll be doing

The Machine Learning Engineering team is responsible for the engineering aspects of our client delivery projects. As a Senior

Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll be essential to helping us achieve that goal by:

Designing and building software and infrastructure to support Machine Learning applications;
Leading engineering interactions with our clients;
Mentoring data scientists and engineers in best practices and new technologies;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.
You will support both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deploy ML to solve real-world problems. To enable this, we work in cross functional teams with representation from commercial and data science specialities to cover all aspects of AI product delivery.


We’re a rapidly growing organisation, so roles are dynamic and subject to change. Your role will evolve alongside business needs, but you can expect your key responsibilities to include:

Scoping projects
Providing technical support during Business Development
Managing and Mentoring technical staff
Technical Delivery


Requirements

Who We're Looking For

At Faculty, your attitude and behaviour are just as important as your technical skill. We look for individuals who can support our values, foster our culture, and deliver for our organisation.

We like people who combine expertise and ambition with optimism -- who are interested in changing the world for the better -- and have the drive and intelligence to make it happen. If you’re the right candidate for us, you probably:

Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.
Excellent communication skills;
Experience in working directly with clients and end users;
Requirements gathering;
Technical planning and scoping;
User acceptance testing;
A drive to learn new technologies and novel applications of existing technologies;
Experience in leading technical delivery; and
Technical mentoring


To succeed in this role, you’ll need demonstrable in the following:

Software Engineering in Python
Linux system management
Docker/Containerisation
CI/CD Technologies
Automated testing
AWS, GCP or Azure experience
Systems design and maintenance


Benefits

What we can offer you

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits…..

Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).
We work hard and make sure we enjoy what we do. So we have frequent socials and informal get-togethers to help make sure you enjoy your time with us. You’ll make friends and professional connections that will last a lifetime.

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

Ship state of the art models to production.

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.

As a Machine Learning Intern, you will:

Design, train and improve upon cutting-edge models
Train extremely large scale models on massive datasets
Explore continual and active learning strategies for streaming data
Publish your work in top-tier conferences and journals
Learn from experienced senior machine learning technical staff
Work closely with product teams to develop solutions
Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build and wear multiple hats!


You may be a good fit if you have:

Proficiency in Python and related ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR
Experience using large-scale distributed training strategies
Familiarity with autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformers
Strong communication and problem-solving skills
A demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products
Bonus: experience writing kernels for GPUs using CUDA
Bonus: experience training on TPUs


If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks:

🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment

      ",2023-01-05,"Who We Are:

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.  




That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis. 




Who You Are:

You love to solve challenging problems and believe there is no problem too large to tackle. You are an innovator passionate about building products from the ground up, and you don't mind getting your hands dirty. Building a startup is a marathon, not a sprint, and you should be willing to be resilient amidst the challenges that arise with building a new company. You deeply desire to create a company that will significantly impact the world. You are passionate about social initiatives, diversity and inclusion. You are an excellent technologist with good experience.




Qualifications:

A knack for learning and creating.
A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
Good English language as it is the language of the startup.




Key Responsibilities:

Design and develop natural language processing systems
Define appropriate datasets for language learning
Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
Develop NLP systems according to requirements
Train the developed model and run evaluation experiments
Find and implement the right algorithms and tools for NLP tasks
Perform statistical analysis of results and refine models
Constantly keep up to date within the field of machine learning
Maintain NLP libraries and frameworks
Implement changes as needed and analyze bugs




Compensation:

All compensation will come as equity geared towards the long-term upside. We are currently pre-revenue. This will be an evolving discussion as we build our paying active user base.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.

Exceptional communicator: you have excellent communication, presentation and interpersonal skills that enable you to quickly establish an emotional bond.

See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


Tasks

You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.


Requirements

An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.

      ",2022-12-09,"About Modular

We believe that AI is a net positive force in the world. Our vision and mission are to help rebuild AI infrastructure to advance humanity and our environment. We will do whatever it takes to empower our customers, team, and company to benefit from that pursuit. You can read about our culture and careers here to understand how we work and what we value.

We are owners and advocates for the underlying technologies, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure. These essential building blocks form the high-quality and coherent experiences our users expect. We aim to drive the pace of innovation for every AI/ML developer.

About the role:

ML developers today face significant friction in taking trained models into deployment. They work in a highly fragmented space, with incomplete and patchwork solutions that require significant tuning and non-generalizable/model-specific enhancements. When problems arise with a given model, the tools at their disposal are largely framework-specific, rather than providing a holistic view of both the model and the execution environment. At Modular, we are building the next generation AI platform that will radically improve the way developers build and deploy AI models.

As an AI Tools Engineer you will build and own tools that will be developed with AI workloads and their unique requirements as the focus. This will include performance and accuracy tracking and debugging tools, as well as tooling to provide greater insight into both AI model and compiler decision making. Your work will directly contribute to developing a next-generation AI developer platform and will be on a critical path for customers.

LOCATION: This role is based out of North America. You can work out of one of our offices in Palo Alto, CA or Seattle, WA, or remotely from home.

What you will do:

Implement developer tools that provide a significantly enhanced experience to AI developers.
Engage with users to understand pain points and critical user journeys.
Design and implement methods to gather useful metrics from the SW stack.
Show users how to use Modular's tools to analyze, debug, and improve latency and accuracy through notebooks, documentation, and tutorials.
Emphasize providing an intuitive and consistent experience across local and cloud environments.
Interface with users to design, build, and maintain tools.


What you bring to the table:

2+ years of experience with software development in C++ and Python with data structures/algorithms.
2+ years of experience testing, maintaining, or launching software products.
Prior experience with developing developer tools and methodologies.
Meticulous in work, analytical in thought and tenacious in attitude.
Team player and problem solver, with an ability to explain complex technical issues with clarity and conciseness.


Helpful experience (Optional):

Experience with developer tooling concepts such as profiling, instrumentation, API tracing, hardware tracing, debugging.
Experience with web frameworks and cloud deployment pipelines.


What Modular brings to the table:

Amazing Team. We are a progressive and agile team with some of the industry's best engineering and product leaders.
Flexible Location. We want you to work where you are most productive and we are a remote-first company. We have offices in Palo Alto, CA and Seattle, WA for collaboration, and will open more next year.
World-class Benefits. In order to attract the best, we need to offer the best. Premier insurance plans, up to 5% 401k matching, very generous WFH setup stipends, flexible paid time off, and more are available to you! Please note that specific benefit packages may vary based on your location.
Competitive Compensation. We offer very strong compensation packages, including stock options. We want people to be focused on their best work and believe in tailoring compensation plans to meet the needs of our workforce.
Team Building Events. We organize regular team onsites and local meetups in different cities.


Working at Modular will enable you to grow quickly as you work alongside incredibly motivated and talented people who have high standards, possess a growth mindset, and a purpose to truly change the world.

Modular is proud to emphasize an equal opportunity, safe environment for people to do their best work. Modular is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements.

This employer participates in E-Verify and will provide the federal government with your Form I-9 information to confirm that you are authorized to work in the U.S. If E-Verify cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is required to give you written instructions and an opportunity to contact Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Social Security Administration (SSA) so you can begin to resolve the issue before the employer can take any action against you, including terminating your employment. Employers can only use E-Verify once you have accepted a job offer and completed the Form I-9.","

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).




Our Team

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.




Our leadership inspires. Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.




We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We currently offer equity packages and other benefits on top of cash compensation. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

Description

Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding.

Life at Builder.ai

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWillYouBuild

The role will have you work on multi-dimensional projects that will test your research chops but also require you to analyse internal and external datasets to help understand both macro and micro trends, within and outside the business. You will work with our Chief Wizard directly and have a front seat view of the business scaling.

Experience creating models
Excellent presentation & story telling skills
Highly analytical thinking approach
Must be competent in, Google Sheets, SQL, Qlik - (or another similar system)

Please note that due to the nature of our current project requirements, applicants must either hold valid existing security clearance, or be eligible for UK security clearance (5 years continuous UK address history, no criminal convictions). Faculty will cover in full any costs associated.

What you'll be doing

The Machine Learning Engineering team is responsible for the engineering aspects of our client delivery projects. As a Senior

Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll be essential to helping us achieve that goal by:

Designing and building software and infrastructure to support Machine Learning applications;
Leading engineering interactions with our clients;
Mentoring data scientists and engineers in best practices and new technologies;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.
You will support both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deploy ML to solve real-world problems. To enable this, we work in cross functional teams with representation from commercial and data science specialities to cover all aspects of AI product delivery.


We’re a rapidly growing organisation, so roles are dynamic and subject to change. Your role will evolve alongside business needs, but you can expect your key responsibilities to include:

Scoping projects
Providing technical support during Business Development
Managing and Mentoring technical staff
Technical Delivery


Requirements

Who We're Looking For

At Faculty, your attitude and behaviour are just as important as your technical skill. We look for individuals who can support our values, foster our culture, and deliver for our organisation.

We like people who combine expertise and ambition with optimism -- who are interested in changing the world for the better -- and have the drive and intelligence to make it happen. If you’re the right candidate for us, you probably:

Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.
Excellent communication skills;
Experience in working directly with clients and end users;
Requirements gathering;
Technical planning and scoping;
User acceptance testing;
A drive to learn new technologies and novel applications of existing technologies;
Experience in leading technical delivery; and
Technical mentoring


To succeed in this role, you’ll need demonstrable in the following:

Software Engineering in Python
Linux system management
Docker/Containerisation
CI/CD Technologies
Automated testing
AWS, GCP or Azure experience
Systems design and maintenance


Benefits

What we can offer you

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits…..

Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).
We work hard and make sure we enjoy what we do. So we have frequent socials and informal get-togethers to help make sure you enjoy your time with us. You’ll make friends and professional connections that will last a lifetime.

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

Ship state of the art models to production.

Design and implement novel research ideas.

Build elegant training/deployment pipelines.

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.

As a Machine Learning Intern, you will:

Design, train and improve upon cutting-edge models
Train extremely large scale models on massive datasets
Explore continual and active learning strategies for streaming data
Publish your work in top-tier conferences and journals
Learn from experienced senior machine learning technical staff
Work closely with product teams to develop solutions
Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build and wear multiple hats!


You may be a good fit if you have:

Proficiency in Python and related ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR
Experience using large-scale distributed training strategies
Familiarity with autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformers
Strong communication and problem-solving skills
A demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products
Bonus: experience writing kernels for GPUs using CUDA
Bonus: experience training on TPUs


If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks:

🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment

🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research

🍽 Free daily lunch

🦷 Full health and dental benefits, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health

      ",2023-01-05,"Who We Are:

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.  




That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis. 




Who You Are:

You love to solve challenging problems and believe there is no problem too large to tackle. You are an innovator passionate about building products from the ground up, and you don't mind getting your hands dirty. Building a startup is a marathon, not a sprint, and you should be willing to be resilient amidst the challenges that arise with building a new company. You deeply desire to create a company that will significantly impact the world. You are passionate about social initiatives, diversity and inclusion. You are an excellent technologist with good experience.




Qualifications:

A knack for learning and creating.
A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
Good English language as it is the language of the startup.




Key Responsibilities:

Design and develop natural language processing systems
Define appropriate datasets for language learning
Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
Develop NLP systems according to requirements
Train the developed model and run evaluation experiments
Find and implement the right algorithms and tools for NLP tasks
Perform statistical analysis of results and refine models
Constantly keep up to date within the field of machine learning
Maintain NLP libraries and frameworks
Implement changes as needed and analyze bugs




Compensation:

All compensation will come as equity geared towards the long-term upside. We are currently pre-revenue. This will be an evolving discussion as we build our paying active user base.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.

Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools.

Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

Our proposition to you

We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.

Your Character Traits

Strong inner drive to get things done: you’re not waiting for others to manage or tell you what to do. You are self-driven and you like to work autonomously.
You hate boxes: You don’t stop when your thing is done, and you don’t point to the other side. Instead, you are eager to learn and support in areas that may not be your core expertise.
Quality ambassador: you combine an obsession with quality with a highly pragmatic prioritisation of tasks to maximize your project throughput.
Exceptional communicator: you have excellent communication, presentation and interpersonal skills that enable you to quickly establish an emotional bond.


You fit in with our team culture if you

See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


Tasks

You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.


Requirements

An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.

We believe that AI is a net positive force in the world. Our vision and mission are to help rebuild AI infrastructure to advance humanity and our environment. We will do whatever it takes to empower our customers, team, and company to benefit from that pursuit. You can read about our culture and careers here to understand how we work and what we value.

We are owners and advocates for the underlying technologies, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure. These essential building blocks form the high-quality and coherent experiences our users expect. We aim to drive the pace of innovation for every AI/ML developer.

About the role:

ML developers today face significant friction in taking trained models into deployment. They work in a highly fragmented space, with incomplete and patchwork solutions that require significant tuning and non-generalizable/model-specific enhancements. When problems arise with a given model, the tools at their disposal are largely framework-specific, rather than providing a holistic view of both the model and the execution environment. At Modular, we are building the next generation AI platform that will radically improve the way developers build and deploy AI models.

As an AI Tools Engineer you will build and own tools that will be developed with AI workloads and their unique requirements as the focus. This will include performance and accuracy tracking and debugging tools, as well as tooling to provide greater insight into both AI model and compiler decision making. Your work will directly contribute to developing a next-generation AI developer platform and will be on a critical path for customers.

LOCATION: This role is based out of North America. You can work out of one of our offices in Palo Alto, CA or Seattle, WA, or remotely from home.

What you will do:

Implement developer tools that provide a significantly enhanced experience to AI developers.
Engage with users to understand pain points and critical user journeys.
Design and implement methods to gather useful metrics from the SW stack.
Show users how to use Modular's tools to analyze, debug, and improve latency and accuracy through notebooks, documentation, and tutorials.
Emphasize providing an intuitive and consistent experience across local and cloud environments.
Interface with users to design, build, and maintain tools.


What you bring to the table:

2+ years of experience with software development in C++ and Python with data structures/algorithms.
2+ years of experience testing, maintaining, or launching software products.
Prior experience with developing developer tools and methodologies.
Meticulous in work, analytical in thought and tenacious in attitude.
Team player and problem solver, with an ability to explain complex technical issues with clarity and conciseness.


Helpful experience (Optional):

Experience with developer tooling concepts such as profiling, instrumentation, API tracing, hardware tracing, debugging.
Experience with web frameworks and cloud deployment pipelines.


What Modular brings to the table:

Amazing Team. We are a progressive and agile team with some of the industry's best engineering and product leaders.
Flexible Location. We want you to work where you are most productive and we are a remote-first company. We have offices in Palo Alto, CA and Seattle, WA for collaboration, and will open more next year.
World-class Benefits. In order to attract the best, we need to offer the best. Premier insurance plans, up to 5% 401k matching, very generous WFH setup stipends, flexible paid time off, and more are available to you! Please note that specific benefit packages may vary based on your location.
Competitive Compensation. We offer very strong compensation packages, including stock options. We want people to be focused on their best work and believe in tailoring compensation plans to meet the needs of our workforce.
Team Building Events. We organize regular team onsites and local meetups in different cities.


Working at Modular will enable you to grow quickly as you work alongside incredibly motivated and talented people who have high standards, possess a growth mindset, and a purpose to truly change the world.

Modular is proud to emphasize an equal opportunity, safe environment for people to do their best work. Modular is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements.

This employer participates in E-Verify and will provide the federal government with your Form I-9 information to confirm that you are authorized to work in the U.S. If E-Verify cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is required to give you written instructions and an opportunity to contact Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Social Security Administration (SSA) so you can begin to resolve the issue before the employer can take any action against you, including terminating your employment. Employers can only use E-Verify once you have accepted a job offer and completed the Form I-9.","

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).




Our Team

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.




Our leadership inspires. Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.




We care about our people and think they deserve the best. We currently offer equity packages and other benefits on top of cash compensation. We aim to continue improving and shaping our offering in all areas of compensation and total rewards to ensure our teams’ efforts are rewarded and we remain competitive.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

Description

Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding.

Life at Builder.ai

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWillYouBuild

About The Role

We are looking for a whipsmart Senior Analyst who can research into a wide array of topics, build models/spreadsheets (google sheets) and narrate back a presentation of their findings. This person needs to be both data first and yet have the power of story telling.

This is an exciting opportunity to work in a fast growing scale-up and yet always be on your toes. The role will have you work on multi-dimensional projects that will test your research chops but also require you to analyse internal and external datasets to help understand both macro and micro trends, within and outside the business. You will work with our Chief Wizard directly and have a front seat view of the business scaling.

Requirements

First Principles thinking
Experience creating models
Excellent presentation & story telling skills
Highly analytical thinking approach
Must be competent in, Google Sheets, SQL, Qlik - (or another similar system)
Strong research techniques
Experience in a similar position would be highly desirable

Benefits

Performance-based bonuses and stock options
24 days of paid annual leave + bank holidays + 2 family days off & time off between Christmas and New Year
Generally flexible working hours
A collaborative culture where unconventional thinkers come together to solve interesting problems and have fun while doing it
Mission-driven company that is making the world a better place

      ",2022-12-11,"Faculty is one of Europe’s leading applied artificial intelligence companies. We build, deploy and operate AI solutions to increase our customers’ performance and help them realise their full potential. We believe that AI should be trustworthy, impactful and beneficial across society. Those principles have shaped our work with more than 230 organisations across the public and private sectors as we help them use AI to understand more deeply, make better decisions and act faster.

To give an example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we built the COVID-19 Early Warning System to forecast hospital admissions and life-saving equipment up to three weeks in advance. The ground-breaking tool helped frontline workers at the NHS save lives. We also work with the Home Office on Counter-Terrorism initiatives - Faculty built an AI model that automatically detects both new and existing propaganda videos and stops them from being uploaded.

Please note that due to the nature of our current project requirements, applicants must either hold valid existing security clearance, or be eligible for UK security clearance (5 years continuous UK address history, no criminal convictions). Faculty will cover in full any costs associated.

What you'll be doing

The Machine Learning Engineering team is responsible for the engineering aspects of our client delivery projects. As a Senior

Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll be essential to helping us achieve that goal by:

Designing and building software and infrastructure to support Machine Learning applications;
Leading engineering interactions with our clients;
Mentoring data scientists and engineers in best practices and new technologies;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.
You will support both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deploy ML to solve real-world problems. To enable this, we work in cross functional teams with representation from commercial and data science specialities to cover all aspects of AI product delivery.


We’re a rapidly growing organisation, so roles are dynamic and subject to change. Your role will evolve alongside business needs, but you can expect your key responsibilities to include:

Scoping projects
Providing technical support during Business Development
Managing and Mentoring technical staff
Technical Delivery


Requirements

Who We're Looking For

At Faculty, your attitude and behaviour are just as important as your technical skill. We look for individuals who can support our values, foster our culture, and deliver for our organisation.

We like people who combine expertise and ambition with optimism -- who are interested in changing the world for the better -- and have the drive and intelligence to make it happen. If you’re the right candidate for us, you probably:

Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.
Excellent communication skills;
Experience in working directly with clients and end users;
Requirements gathering;
Technical planning and scoping;
User acceptance testing;
A drive to learn new technologies and novel applications of existing technologies;
Experience in leading technical delivery; and
Technical mentoring


To succeed in this role, you’ll need demonstrable in the following:

Software Engineering in Python
Linux system management
Docker/Containerisation
CI/CD Technologies
Automated testing
AWS, GCP or Azure experience
Systems design and maintenance


Benefits

What we can offer you

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits…..

Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).
We work hard and make sure we enjoy what we do. So we have frequent socials and informal get-togethers to help make sure you enjoy your time with us. You’ll make friends and professional connections that will last a lifetime.

Description

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. ’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s worldclass ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder.ai

At Builder.ai, we’re looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff done attitude. We celebrate diversity and encourage everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency). Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models.

Why we need this role?

Builder.ai is transforming the way businesses create software. We’re democratising an outdated industry with broken processes, and we need compelling, engaging and exciting content to help us do it.

We believe ‘Content is King’ and will help us become the leading voice in our industry. We want to create content that is meaningful to our customers and wows our prospects.

So, we are looking for an experienced writer to join our content team. You will have you fiddling with taglines on website pages, write blog posts for feature announcements, put together thought leadership articles for guest publications, create educational collateral as sales enablement tools, frame scripts for videos and every other type of copy you can think of. We want you to grow your profile within the tech industry and reflect Builder.ai’s voice in everything you do.

Sitting within the newly created Content Team, this role is perfect for someone wanting to make an impact with the content they create.

What will you be doing?

Writing! More specifically: Blog content, in-depth guides, social media copy, whitepapers, campaigns, collateral and more.
Crafting copy that matches the Builder.ai tone of voice
Working through a content pipeline set for you
Supporting Builder.ai as a business with any content requests
Measure impact and perform analysis to improve KPIs.
Contribute to the localization of process and content to ensure consistency across regions

Requirements

Tech-savvy with the ability to make complex technical matters easy-to understand even for non-technical people.
At least 2 years writing experience, joirnalist, agency or B2B tech background is preferable
Online copywriting experience
Basic SEO understanding Experience or interest within the tech/digital/software/online space (preferable)
Experience in B2B/SaaS space (preferable)
Strong communication skills
Excellent command of the English language
A stickler for grammatical correctness

Benefits

Health and Wellness benefits including competitive medical for self, spouse and children.
Performance-based bonuses.
Generous vacation and time off benefits including paid holidays.
Generally flexible working hours.
Working in our newly constructed beautiful office space based out at Gurugram.
A collaborative culture where unconventional thinkers come together to solve interesting problems and having fun while doing it.
Mission-driven company that is making the world a better place.","

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As a Machine Learning Intern, you will:

Design, train and improve upon cutting-edge models
Train extremely large scale models on massive datasets
Explore continual and active learning strategies for streaming data
Publish your work in top-tier conferences and journals
Learn from experienced senior machine learning technical staff
Work closely with product teams to develop solutions
Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build and wear multiple hats!


You may be a good fit if you have:

Proficiency in Python and related ML frameworks such as Tensorflow, TF-Serving, JAX, and XLA/MLIR
Experience using large-scale distributed training strategies
Familiarity with autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformers
Strong communication and problem-solving skills
A demonstrated passion for applied NLP models and products
Bonus: experience writing kernels for GPUs using CUDA
Bonus: experience training on TPUs


If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks:

🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment

      ",2023-01-05,"Who We Are:

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.  




That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis. 




Who You Are:

You love to solve challenging problems and believe there is no problem too large to tackle. You are an innovator passionate about building products from the ground up, and you don't mind getting your hands dirty. Building a startup is a marathon, not a sprint, and you should be willing to be resilient amidst the challenges that arise with building a new company. You deeply desire to create a company that will significantly impact the world. You are passionate about social initiatives, diversity and inclusion. You are an excellent technologist with good experience.




Qualifications:

A knack for learning and creating.
A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
Good English language as it is the language of the startup.




Key Responsibilities:

Design and develop natural language processing systems
Define appropriate datasets for language learning
Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
Develop NLP systems according to requirements
Train the developed model and run evaluation experiments
Find and implement the right algorithms and tools for NLP tasks
Perform statistical analysis of results and refine models
Constantly keep up to date within the field of machine learning
Maintain NLP libraries and frameworks
Implement changes as needed and analyze bugs




Compensation:

All compensation will come as equity geared towards the long-term upside. We are currently pre-revenue. This will be an evolving discussion as we build our paying active user base.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

Our people are our main asset. Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.

Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent
Young Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

In late 2021, Bloom closed $1.1M in Seed funding to accelerate our vision and reach mass customer adoption. Backers include iNovia, Forum Ventures, and more. Notably, AIX ventures, a new AI-focused fund, includes GP’s like the CEO of Kaggle, Covariant, and Chris Manning, a computer science professor at Stanford with over 150,000 citations who heads the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL).

Our founding team is great at engineering and at sales. We are looking for top-tier AI talent to make this vision real. Generative AI is at the heart of our product and is arguably the most important part of the business.

Opportunity

This is an opportunity for an incredibly talented AI engineer who wants to join a de-risked startup with a big vision.
The customers are there, the product is already there and de-risked
Cutting-edge AI, pushing research forward. Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.
Your work will be put directly into our system to directly increase our clients’ revenue - performance is quantitative and clear
Have a huge impact on the culture since you will be one of the crucial team members

Through our expertise, mindset, culture and most importantly with your help we are turning the AI landscape upside down. Are you up for the challenge?

Our proposition to you

We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.
Transparent salary and career planning from day one.
A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.
Flexible, family-friendly work environment - we have parents in the team and support them.


Success in the role means that you will have

After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.
After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.
After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.


Your Character Traits

Strong inner drive to get things done: you’re not waiting for others to manage or tell you what to do. You are self-driven and you like to work autonomously.
You hate boxes: You don’t stop when your thing is done, and you don’t point to the other side. Instead, you are eager to learn and support in areas that may not be your core expertise.
Quality ambassador: you combine an obsession with quality with a highly pragmatic prioritisation of tasks to maximize your project throughput.
Exceptional communicator: you have excellent communication, presentation and interpersonal skills that enable you to quickly establish an emotional bond.


You fit in with our team culture if you

Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players, not data ninjas.
Have a highly ambitious, curious and driven mindset while being able to convey humility and respect for different opinions.
Feel like a global citizen with a strong passion for openness and diversity.
See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


Tasks

You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.


Requirements

An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.
Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.
Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.
Excellent written and verbal communication, with the ability to work cross-functionally with non-scientific experts.


Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

We believe that AI is a net positive force in the world. Our vision and mission are to help rebuild AI infrastructure to advance humanity and our environment. We will do whatever it takes to empower our customers, team, and company to benefit from that pursuit. You can read about our culture and careers here to understand how we work and what we value.

We are owners and advocates for the underlying technologies, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure. These essential building blocks form the high-quality and coherent experiences our users expect. We aim to drive the pace of innovation for every AI/ML developer.

About the role:

ML developers today face significant friction in taking trained models into deployment. They work in a highly fragmented space, with incomplete and patchwork solutions that require significant tuning and non-generalizable/model-specific enhancements. When problems arise with a given model, the tools at their disposal are largely framework-specific, rather than providing a holistic view of both the model and the execution environment.

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:

World Economic Forum Pioneer
One of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation Lab
Top startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017
Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open Talent

Our Values

Our mission drives us forward. Our values guide us along the way. In order to meet our goals, we require passion from everyone on the team that is driven by our purpose. We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:

Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.
Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.
Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.
Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..
Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

You made my day


become a daymaker! Take advantage of the opportunity to help us revolutionise the contact centre industry...


We are a game changer - innovative, contemporary and different. A company where it's fun to be a customer, a talent but also an employee. At our Munich location, we develop forward-looking solutions for the contact center industry. In Sofia we implement our products for our customers.

Traditional contact centres often work according to the same principle: Open-plan offices and fixed working hours, a situation which is also associated with inflexibility and low pay for employees. All of this also leads to lack of motivation on the part of the employees and high costs for customers.

Yoummday takes a completely different approach. Since we were founded in 2016, we committed ourselves to fair and reliable remuneration as well as tasks that motivate our independent talents. All of this frees our customers from inflexibility and high costs.

We have revolutionized the contact center industry. Join the revolution. Become a daymaker.

Description

Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding.

Life at Builder.ai

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together and savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWillYouBuild

About The Role

We are looking for a whipsmart Senior Analyst who can research into a wide array of topics, build models/spreadsheets (google sheets) and narrate back a presentation of their findings. This person needs to be both data first and yet have the power of story telling.

This is an exciting opportunity to work in a fast growing scale-up and yet always be on your toes. The role will have you work on multi-dimensional projects that will test your research chops but also require you to analyse internal and external datasets to help understand both macro and micro trends, within and outside the business. You will work with our Chief Wizard directly and have a front seat view of the business scaling.

Requirements

First Principles thinking
Experience creating models
Excellent presentation & story telling skills
Highly analytical thinking approach
Must be competent in, Google Sheets, SQL, Qlik - (or another similar system)
Strong research techniques
Experience in a similar position would be highly desirable

Benefits

Performance-based bonuses and stock options
24 days of paid annual leave + bank holidays + 2 family days off & time off between Christmas and New Year
Generally flexible working hours
A collaborative culture where unconventional thinkers come together to solve interesting problems and have fun while doing it
Mission-driven company that is making the world a better place
